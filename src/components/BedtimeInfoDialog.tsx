            <strong>1. Activation criteria</strong>
            <br />
            We only start predicting once baby is at least {BEDTIME_MIN_AGE_WEEKS} weeks old and we have {BEDTIME_MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE} nights with a stretch â‰¥ {Math.round(BEDTIME_MIN_GAP_MINUTES / 60)}h. Right now your baby is {currentAgeWeeks} weeks old and we have {sampleSize} qualified nights in the last {BEDTIME_ANALYSIS_DAYS} days.
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>2. Detection of the "night" stretch</strong>
            <br />
            Each evening feeding is tagged with the time to the next feeding. If the next feeding is at least {Math.round(BEDTIME_MIN_GAP_MINUTES / 60)} hours away and either crosses midnight or happens after 5&nbsp;pm, we consider it a bedtime candidate.
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>3. Rolling 30-day analysis</strong>
            <br />
            We work on a sliding {BEDTIME_ANALYSIS_DAYS}-day window to stay adaptive. Times are converted to your device timezone so the window reflects your local routine.
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>4. Window & confidence</strong>
            <br />
            We look at the 50% central band (between the 25th and 75th percentile) of the bedtime candidates to define the suggested window. Reliability blends sample size and variability: more nights and tighter clustering increase confidence.
          </div>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
            ðŸ’¡ Tip: keep logging each evening feeding. Missing nights or travel days widen the window and lower confidence.
          </div>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground p-2 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg">
            â€¢ "Learning" means we still need a few more evenings.<br />
            â€¢ "Too young" waits until {BEDTIME_MIN_AGE_WEEKS} weeks.<br />
            â€¢ Once the indicator is green, the window updates automatically every time you add a feeding.
